# 🧮 IntelliCalc – AI-Powered Cross-Platform Calculator

IntelliCalc is an **AI-powered, cross-platform calculator web application** that I designed and built to handle **text-based, image-based, and handwritten mathematical inputs** using a combination of **Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and symbolic AI**.

📄 The work and results from this project were **later published as a peer-reviewed research paper at AIR 2025 (Springer LNNS)**.

## 📌 Project Background

Traditional calculators are limited to numerical computation and basic algebra. They cannot:
- Interpret handwritten equations
- Understand word-based problem statements
- Analyze visual mathematical content (diagrams, graphs)

**IntelliCalc** was created to overcome these limitations by introducing a **multi-modal AI-driven computation system** that bridges traditional calculators and intelligent problem-solving tools.

After building and evaluating the system, the project was formalized into a **research publication**, validating its architecture, performance, and real-world applicability.
